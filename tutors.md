# Our Tutors

## Dawn Pickerill

I have lived and worked in Plymouth all of my life.  I have a law degree from the University of Exeter (2.1) and qualified as a solicitor, a career in which I worked for over 20 years, in parallel with which I began volunteering in primary schools on a regular basis in 2009.  In 2015, I decided to change career to concentrate on working in the field of education and I have since attended various courses aimed at improving my tutoring skills.  I have since tutored both adults and children, in particular children of primary age.

I have worked with small groups of up to 6 children and also on a one to one basis to improve reading, maths, literacy, reading and handwriting skills.  I have worked with all age groups from Foundation to Year 6 on a wide range of subjects and have worked with children across a wide range of ability from children who require extra help with grasping certain concepts to children who need to stretch in their learning and deepen their understanding.  

I love helping others with their learning and very much enjoy my work.  I have a strong academic background and prides myself on maintaining high standards of English and maths.  I also very much enjoys languages and music, particularly piano and singing.  I have an understanding of different educational needs and of working with children across the different range of ability.  One of my greatest strengths is my patient approach to teaching and also my sense of humour; I firmly believe that everyone learns better when they are having fun!
