## Where Does Tutoring Take Place ? 

Tutoring either takes place in the Woolwell area where we are based or in the student’s own home, depending on the availability of the tutor.

When Does Tutoring Take Place?
Sessions usually take place on weekdays after school in term time.  In addition, there are also sessions on weekdays in the early afternoon.

## Does all Tutoring take place on a one to one basis?

We specialise in one to one tutoring but can also offer tutoring in small groups if places are available.
 
## Are Acorn Tutors CRB checked?
Yes

## Do you Offer an Initial Free Meeting?

Yes.  It is very important that students are comfortable with their tutor and for that reason, we offer an initial session of up to half an hour to allow the tutor and the student the opportunity to meet each other and discuss their individual needs.


## Why us?

At Acorn Tutoring we passionately believe in bringing out the best in our students by recognising that each individual is different, both in the way that they learn best and in their individual talents and abilities.

We believe in a patient, fun approach so that all students can enjoy learning whatever their age!
