## How Much Does it Cost to Use Acorn?

We charge £23 per hour for one to one sessions and £14 per hour for group sessions.

If you require tutoring in your own home, please mention this when you make your
initial enquiry as this will depend on the tutor’s availability to travel to you and there
may be a small additional charge to cover travel time and mileage depending upon
where the student is based.

We offer a 15% discount when you book a block of 10 lessons.
