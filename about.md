## About Acorn Tutoring

<div class = "box">
The name of Acorn Tutoring was inspired by the motto of Sir Francis Drake "Sic
Parvis Magna" meaning "Thus great things from small things (come)". Just as
little acorns grown into tall strong oak trees, so children have the ability to
grow and develop both mentally and physically to achieve their full potential
and become great.

At Acorn Tutoring we believe passionately in bringing out the best in every child by 
recognising that each child is different – in the way that they learn and
in their individual talents and abilities. We believe in a patient, fun approach
so that children can enjoy learning.

We offer tutoring in *French* and *English* for children and adults as well as *11
plus maths and English*. Children’s tutoring can be provided on a one to one
basis or in small groups.
