### The Armpit of Doom – Ken Nesbitt

Today I walked into my big brother’s room,   
and that’s when I saw it: The Armpit of Doom.   
I wasn’t expecting The Armpit at all.   
I shrieked and fell backward and grabbed for the wall.   
The Armpit was smelly. The Armpit was hairy.   
The Armpit was truly disgusting and scary.   
I wanted to vomit. I wanted to cry.   
I wanted to flee from its all-seeing eye.   
My skin started crawling with goosebumps and chills.   
My brain began screaming to head for the hills.   
I tried to escape but I knew I could not.   
In horror, I found I was glued to the spot.    
“Will somebody help me!?” I started to shout,   
till fumes overcame me and made me pass out.   
And that’s why I’m here in this hospital room;   
it’s all on account of The Armpit of Doom.   
I’m still feeling shaken. I’m queasy and pale,   
but lucky I lived and can tell you my tale.   
So take my advice… If you ever go near   
your big brothers room, bring a whole lot of gear:   
A gas mask and goggles, a helmet and shield,   
or maybe a space suit that’s perfectly sealed.   
And then, only then, when you’re fully prepared,   
step in very slowly and hope you’ll be spared.   
But, if you’re afraid of the Armpit of Doom,   
stay far, far away from your big brother’s room.

### Father William – Lewis Carroll

"You are old, Father William," the young man said,   
&quot;And your hair has become very white;   
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—      
Do you think, at your age age, it is right?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; Father William replied to his son,   
&quot;I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I&#39;m perfectly sure I have none,   
Why, I do it again and again.&quot;

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot; as I mentioned before,   
And have grown most uncommonly fat;   
Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door—   
Pray, what is the reason of that?&quot;   

&quot;In my youth,&quot; said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,   
&quot;I kept all my limbs very supple   
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—   
Allow me to sell you a couple?&quot;

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot; and your jaws are too weak   
For anything tougher than suet;   
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the back—   
Pray, how did you manage to do it?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; said his father, &quot;I took to the law,   
And argued each case with my wife;   
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,   
Has lasted the rest of my life.&quot;   

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;one would hardly suppose   
That your eye was steady as ever;   
Yet, you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—   
What made you so awfully clever?&quot;   

&quot;I have answered three questions, and that is enough,&quot;   
Said his father. &quot;Don&#39;t give yourself airs!   
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?   
Be off, or I&#39;ll kick you downstairs!

## Limericks

Limericks are great fun. They are often very funny and complete nonsense. They

only have five lines.

* The first line begins “There was a ….” And ends with the name of a person or
the place they come from eg “There was a young lady called Grace” or “There
was a young man from Hong Kong”

* Lines 1,2 and 5 rhyme with each other and should have 7-10 syllables

* Lines 3 and 4 rhyme also rhyme with each other and have 5-7 syllables


### Here are some examples by Edward Lear

There was an old man in a tree

Whose whiskers were lovely to see

But the birds of the air

Pluck’d them perfectly bare,

To make themselves nests on that tree!

----

### Here is another

There is a Young Lady whose nose

Continually prospers and grows;

When it grew out of sight,

She exclaimed in a fright

“Oh! Farewell to the end of my nose!”

Now you can try to make your own limerick – make it short and funny and as far

fetched and silly as you like! We will add our favourites to the examples above!
